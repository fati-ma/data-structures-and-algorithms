# Breadth-First Traversal of a Graph

## Challenge
Implement a breadth-first traversal on a graph.

## Approach & Efficiency

I created a breadth-first traversal method that accepts a starting node that returns a collection of nodes in the order they were visited, then displayed the collection.


Time: O(n^2)

Space: O(n)
