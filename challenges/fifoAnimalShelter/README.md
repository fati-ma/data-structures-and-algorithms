# First-in, First out Animal Shelter.

# Challenge 

- Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.
- Implement the following methods:
   - `enqueue(animal)`: adds `animal` to the shelter. `animal` can be either a dog or a cat object.
   - `dequeue(pref)`: returns either a dog or a cat. If `pref` is not "dog" or "cat" then return null.

# Approach and Efficiency

- Time : O(1)
- Space : O(n)

# Solution
